# BiblePicker
Android application that randomly sorts the books of the Bible

This is an Android application that I made that stores the books of the Bible and allows the user to randomly sort them. The user is also able to mark the books as read (removing them from the list) so they no longer appear. There are reset options and re-sorting options in the menu system. The order of the books are saved so that they persist between app sessions.
